	Select Character

Following sequence diagram illustrates the scenario explained below:

Scenario: Player presses the proper button from main menu in order to enter the select character page. 
The system initializes a new window where player has different options for changing the character he 
is using. Every character has different attributes, therefore player might want to change character in 
order to improve attributes of the character he is playing with during the game. All characters are 
going to be available to player. When the game starts initially, a default character will be assigned 
to the player therefore, the player does not need to select a character before he starts playing.
