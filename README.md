" A day in Bilkent" is a Arcade Style SHMUP - or Shoot 'em Up - game where the task of the player is to destroy enemies spawned. The game has different modes like Story Mode and Survival. The player is a student who is trapped inside a Bilkent themed box.

They have to dodge different type of enemies. Like:
